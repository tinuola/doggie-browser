# Product Design Engineer
---
## Introduction
Welcome! Thank you for your interest in working on the GumGum Product Design team!

Our team works on a wide variety of projects and our members are required to have a diverse skillset. We're looking for web engineers with an eye for design. Not only do the things we build need to work, they need to look great too. We value collaboration, communication, and a desire to learn new skills. You should be comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (knowledge of React is a plus) as well as being familiar with design tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch. As such, we have set up a few exercises that will help us to gauge your competency in these different areas.

## Instructions
- There are a few exercises below. You don't have to do every one, but the more you do helps us get a better idea of your experience. Or, describing how you would implement or providing psuedocode is also helpful.
- Each file has some instructions. Feel free to modify the files when you submit it back and to structure your files/code in any way you like.
- You can use any online resources (as long as they are available for us).
- We have an internal design system that you are welcome to use in your code.
- Please let us know an ETA for your submission (preferably within 7 days).

### Things to consider
- Please be considerate while coding and consider how your code might be read/understood by other people.
- Remember that good code is only part of the evaluation - we also want you to show off your design skills!
- If you have any questions or suggestions, please ask or let us know!
