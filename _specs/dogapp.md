# Dog App

One of the responsibilities of our Product Design Engineers is to quickly create lightweight web tools, apps, and prototypes. In this exercise, we're making an app that allows the user to browse images of dogs by breed. This tool should be functional, with a clean, intuitive UI.  

Your app should have a mechanism for selecting / browsing breeds of dogs. Once a breed is selected, the image results should be displayed in a responsive grid for the user to scroll through. Bonus points if the results are filteable by sub-breed.

The user should be able to change breed and get a new set of results.

You can submit the app to us in any way you like. Suggestions include using Create React App, a Github Repo, or a [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) link.

### Key Requirements:
 - Utilize the Dog API documentated [here](http://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
 - App should be written in HTML/CSS/JS (ideally utilizing React)
 - UI should be clear, intuitive and aesthetically pleasing
 - Bonus points if you utilize [GumGum's Design System](http://ds.gumgum.com/stable/)
 - [More Documentation Here](http://ds.gumgum.com/stable/md/docs/index.html)

### Things to Consider:
 - How will your layout work across both desktop and mobile devices
 - How do you allow users to browse breeds?
 - How do you juggle both real and perceptual page load speeds to ensure a smooth user experience.
